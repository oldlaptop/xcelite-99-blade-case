This is a parameterized holder for Xcelite series 99 interchangeable screwdriver
blades (though I've only tested it on my Jensen/Techni-Tool knockoffs). It's
designed to take up a minimum of space and only hold the actual blades; it is
assumed you already have a nice spot for the handles and just need to keep some
extra blades organized.

Such things as the number of blades the model will hold are parameterized; you
can either change parameters manually (read common.scad first) or generate files
with your desired values with the included Makefile. Try the `help` target
first:

$ make help

Example for twelve blades, with extra clearance for large nut drivers (up to
a quarter inch larger diameter than the blade's shaft):

$ make models previews OPENSCAD_FLAGS='-D no_blades=12 \
                                       -D tool_spacing_x=0.25 \
                                       -D tool_spacing_y=0.125'
